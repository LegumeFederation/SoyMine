# priority for fields declared in superclass are not overridden by different order in subclass
# e.g. identfier and organism always have priority as defined in BioEntity

# For example, to give interpro prioritiy over uniprot for the 'shortName' field of ProteinDomain:
#
# ProteinDomain.shortName = interpro, uniprot

# To give flybase priority over all other sources for Gene name:
#
# Gene.name = flybase, *
